We can help you secure admission to top colleges and universities in Canada.. Please note that schools in Canada require applicants to pay an admission application fee. The application fee will cost you 130,000 francs. Additionally, upon admission approval, schools in Canada may require you to pay a school fee deposit, which typically ranges from $3,000 to $8,000, depending on the school. This fee amounts to approximately 2 to 4 million francs, depending on the school and course. The school will provide you with a maximum one-month deadline to make this payment in order to secure your spot. You will need to pay this fee directly to the college, and they will issue you a proof of payment (receipt), which you will need to send along with your documents to the embassy.

Please note that if you are not granted a visa, the school will refund this fee. Once we secure your admission, you will need to pay a service fee of 100,000 francs. This amount must be paid before we send you the admission letter package. We will provide you with a picture of the letter to confirm that your admission has been granted. Please note that this fee is only payable after you have been granted admission.
